# Tips:
# - Uses reusable workflow to check for changes since last successful run
# - Only runs if there are changes since the last successful nightly build
# - Manual execution allows "force-execution" option to bypass change check
# - Remove nuget-projects if you only need .wepkg assets
# - Set publish-packages: false if you don't want to publish to NuGet.org and Azure Storage
# - Update storage-account-name and storage-container-name for your specific setup
